<TEXT>Have all the toys in this car, have driven 7000 miles to date. Owned many cars in my 50 years of driving and this is by far the best. Enough performance and great quiet and comfort. Very smooth in every way. Getting 25+ mpg with no problems to date. If I could build it myself I would trade the mmi for touch screen nav, make the manual a little tighter shifting, but overall the best ride my wife and I ever had! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 2009 A5 for two months now, and I continue to be delighted every time I take it out of my garage, I feel like a child with a new toy. I'm pampered by the amenities such as the excellent back-up camera, the i- pod integration system, the crisp 6- speed shifter, and the amazingly comfortable seats. I love the screen over the sunroof, which allows a little light but not enough to make me squint against the sun. The exterior styling is quietly elegant - the daytime running lights are cooler than I can say, and I love the keyless entry which keeps me from digging in my purse for my keys. I routinely get 33 mpg on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The lovely black glossy finish. The easy-to-use nav system. The comfortable seats. The acceleration of the 6-speed transmission. All- wheel drive - a "must-have" in North Dakota. My bicycle fits in the back!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I held onto my 1998 A4 for 11 years, before getting the A5 S-Line 3.2 MT in early May. I was looking for something sportier, but with the same quattro like 4WD since I live in CT and I like the feel of quattro on a snow covered highway. The A5 has been a dream. The looks and fit of the exterior is exceptional. The interior is remarkable for its price range. The 265HP is completely sufficient to address the 98% of my driving. I got Drive Select and it feels like two different cars in one. Best yet, so few of these on the road and people regularly proffer estimates of $75k. You want a daily driver that satisfies a need for sport without spending a small fortune? This is it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior style (German with an Italian flair), S-line style in particular. Interior style and fit (befits a $100k car). Audi Drive Select ($2k gets you the equivalent of 2 different car personalities)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Chose the A5 for its beauty and refinement. No disappointments as it has exceeded our expectations. Our 2nd Audi as we need awd and like the quality furnishings. But this baby has smooooth power and delivering 25+ mpg so far. Chose select drive, tech package and nav and all works delightfully. The 6 sp manual works flawlessly with plenty of torque in every gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'5" tall and need a car I can fit in. Rented an Audi A5 in Italy in January 2009 and fit great so shopped for one back home in California. Test drove the A5 and loved it. But liked the S-Line meteor gray looks much better so bought that one. Am loving it. So much fun to drive and there is enough head room. Not much visibility behind, but with the rear video camera and warning sounds, and side mirror driver assist-really don't need the visibility. Quiet ride, fun to drive, and I get many random compliments in parking lots. Only really bad thing is that I hate the lumbar on the sporty seats. Cannot get a comfortable position. Big bump in my lower back. No other seat does this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 months I still look back at it and smile, the lines are great, the LED lights are AWESOME!! Being 1 of 3 in my area an S5 nothing to say about that, but the other A5 has the basic, if u can spend the money get the upgrades 19", B&O system and as I'm reading the reviews the standard leather isn't good, I have the Milano and can't complain. I will say seat positioning is hard to find, but i haven't found a car that makes it easy! I also have the Dynamic Control. If u like to be aggressive sometimes it's worth it, the car totally changes under you (Trans, Suspen, Handle) and I have to say, for the small HRS power I have knocked out some pretty beefed up cars when I hit that button.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The body of this car is by far the best looking on the road today. And Deep Sea Blue is the most beautiful color I?ve seen. In the shade it looks black, but in the sunlight it?s a gorgeous three dimensional metallic shade of dark blue. I think the darker colors bring out the lines better than the lighter ones, but I?ve read other reviews that say the opposite. The conclusion: the car has awesome lines regardless of color. The MMI isn?t as confusing as some reviews say; however, most actions are a two-step process. It?s a little more work, but there are SO many options for comfort, information, entertainment, etc. If you?re considering this car, go drive one, you?ll love it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Color and style are stunning. I absolutely love Side Assist for highway driving. Bang & Olufsen Sound w/Sirius & ipod interface is the best around. Everything just speaks elegance. With the manual trans, it?s the perfect blend of sports car and class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the money, one of the best cars I have owned. I have received so much interest from other drivers whether driving it or walking up and people stopping to inquire. Driving impression for such a heavy car is terrific and well balanced. The all wheel drive and 19 inch wheels no doubt compensate. One reviewer complained about the steering. I don't see it. I have not heard rattle, squeak or shutter. The fit and build quality is tremendous. Plus, you're not seeing yourself coming down the road in a 3 series. The v6 has great power. The V8 blows you away, but so does the gas. Great car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Shopped long and hard and considered BMW3 and Z4, Mercedes C300 and SLK, Infiniti G37, Cadillac CTS and Audi TT. In my opinion, the A5 offered the best combination of style,performance, comfort and value and I have not been disappointed after four months and 5000 miles. MPG of 20.3 with estimated 20% highway/80% city. Plenty of room for two sets of golf clubs in the spacious trunk. I enjoy the look of the 19" Y wheels but would not recommend them to those of you that do the majority of your driving on the highway due to a rougher ride. Minor nitpicks for excessive brake dust (although it appears to be moderating) and for a slight roughness when shifting from second to third.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall elegance both inside and out. The rich dark hue of the Deep Sea Blue paint at twilight. Six speed manual and, of course, the B & O premium sound system cranking out Serius Blues.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in 2000 BMW 328i. Had always planned on replacing with another BMW but I haven't been impressed with the current designs and decided to make the switch. Looked at a number of cars in this segment but ultimately choose the A5 for the practicality of the AWD, decent MPG, and of course the stunning looks (don't buy this car if you don't like being gawked at). Acceleration and handling are good but there are certainly cars with better. Got to test out the Quattro last month in some serious snow and ice... and it was unbelievable. For me it was all about being able to drive in the winter. If that's not an issue than I think the competition is stiff for the A5.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LED daytime running lights- soon they'll be ubiquitous but for now quite exotic looking (wish I could see them when I'm driving). Technology package- Side Assist and Smart key. Huge trunk. MMI is surprisingly easy to learn. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After drooling for this car for the better part of a year, I finally ordered the car last July. Unfortunately, due to availability issues, I was unable to drive the configuration I ordered (18" tires, M/T). The car's ride and handling easily surpassed my expectations (as well as my previous 2002 A4 w/ sport suspension. Engine is silky smooth, with a light clutch but excellent feedback. The car is extremely quiet, and combined with the Bang & Olfsen radio, just a pure joy to drive</TEXT>

<TEXT>I finally traded in my 2001 BMW 330 for this car and although it is a nice car, I miss the BMW just a bit. The long wheelbase makes navigating in tight situations tough and the standard leather feels really cheap. Wish I would have paid for the leather upgrade. Also, wish it came standard with the S-line seats. The standard seats feel a little too flat and make it tough to really have fun with the car. Don't get me wrong, this car is sweet. It is awesome to drive and the performance definitely rivals a BMW. Much cheaper than the 335 coupe too. Really like the technology controls and the B&O sound system rocks. Tough to go wrong. Wish I had more money to buy the upgrades.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, interior controls, sound system, smooth ride, fun to drive, highway acceleration. Manual transmission started off a little rough but drives like a dream now after three weeks. Lots of room inside and trunk is huge. Interior styling feels nice, not much hard plastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2009 A5 S line with all the bells and whistles. My 3rd Audi. Bought after my 1st Benz that I got ripped off from my G35 coupe trade in. Still breaking it though so I will get back after a few months for a full review. Didn't do the drive mode button though...waste of money. Still trying to get used to seat position, haven't found perfect yet. Shame it doesn't have as much power as the G37 with the V6. I would have went with the lower powered turbo instead or diesel if an option here in the US.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own an A5 S-Line version in red. I love it after stepping down from a 1997 A8. The car was worth waiting for and it is really a large sport car. This thing handles like a dream, but if it didn't have 19 in wheels with summer tires the ride wouldn't feel so brutal over bad pavement. The combination velour and leather seats are firm and supportive, a good thing for spirited driving. These seats are not as cushy as the A8, but this is a different beast. I like the driving position so much that I have changed my position in other cars to replicate the position. The trunk is only 3 cubic feet less than the A8, this means it is huge (about 16 cubic ft).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bang & Olufsen sound, handling, trunk size, driving position, engine, voice commands, MMI/navigator, exterior styling. There is an interface for an iPod. In dash 6-disc CD player. I like the redundant steering wheel controls. Bluetooth, voice command controls are appreciated.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the most fun car I have ever owned. My last car was a BMW 335 and the power and acceleration of the A5 is just as good. I read some reviews saying this car lacked acceleration power, so I drove test drove both the manual and the automatic. The difference was night and day. For anyone who wants a serious sports car with amazing handling, I would recommend the manual version of the A5- -while the automatic is nice, the manual drives and feels much more like the S5, but about 10K less expensive. I was considering the BMW X6, but the A5 was more fun to drive with much better gas mileage. Seriously, forget the tiptronic--only about $1200 more for auto, but a downgrade in my opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Amazing value. I've owned a 911Cab, 535i, SL55AMG and CL500 in the past 5 years. Ridiculous yes but I like cars. None of these come close to my new loaded '09 A5 for the dollar. Yes, the SL55 had the power & torque but not the value or the back seat for kids. I also drove the S5 but glad I bought the A5 instead with drive select. Sometimes I want the 911 handling and other times the Lexus sofa. With DriveSelect, its your decsion and it all works! I predict MB, BMW and Lexus will lose market share to Audi over the next few years and rightfully so. "Car of the Year" ...if you can find one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The B & O system is absolutely the best car audio I've ever heard. Radio, NAV, ipod & blue tooth integration are flawless! Arm rest slides fwd with adjustable height to match shifter elevation. Large boot. With 500 miles on car in last 2 weeks, I have no regrets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This has been a hectic journey. Ten months, and three different A5 orders, I got my Audi. I originally opted for a Deep Sea Blue A5, but I settled for Brilliant Black. All I can say is wow. At just about every stop-light, I will get stares are looks from other drivers.When I go to a restaurant, valet will park me in the front. When I get into my car with the intelligent key, I am relaxed by the Bang & Olufson sound system. In terms of safety, I don't think you can get much better. Rear backup camera, tons of airbags, and sticky tires which prevent me from sliding. Overall, I do not regret going from a 2006 325xi to this car. I highly do not regret leaving the BMW Brand. I am happy I bought it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2008 A5 on order, but fortunately I delayed the order so I could get a 2009. Worth the wait. I traded a RS6 and am far happier. Don't feel like I gave up much performance (yes, I drove the S5 also) but the gained a 50% or better increase in mileage. Handling is the best of any Audi I've owned. Car is beautiful and I have gotten more compliments on the car than I had with the Porsche Carerra. The '09 has the Audi sensors on the side mirrors that show a warning light for traffic in your blind spot. There is on the fly control of steering, suspension, and shift characteristics from gentle to aggresive. iPod combined with B & O sound is fantastic with no distortion at full volume. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2009 has voice activation and it is a joy to use. No problems with it understanding me from the git go. Can call up a radio station by name, including going from the traffic report on AM to the oldies in Sirius with a single request. Can call up nav, ask for it to find a gas station by voice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is simply amazing all around. Comes with a nice price tag, but definitely worth every last penny. Exterior styling and especially interior fit/finish are top notch. The performance for V6 is quite good and the Quattro really makes you stick to the road. Its really nice not having to worry about the back- end getting away from you. I get so many looks in this car I'm afraid a few people haven't wrecked looking at it because they stare so long. Overall, I give this car a solid 10, it is everything I thought it would be and more!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had test drives in the G37, TT and A5 and had to think long and hard on what was a very difficult choice. The A5 finally won me over with its fabulous lines matched perfectly to a class leading interior and Audi build quality. I'm giving up a 2003 BMW 330ci which I really love for this car. I came to the conclusion that there comes a time in life when it's not the fastest 0-60 time that matters. The A5 is responsive enough for me (although the D position is pretty woeful for spirited driving) in sport or manual shift mode. Driving home from the dealership (83 miles) with the A5 was a joy. Long distance cruising in this car is a pleasure. Sound insulation is excellent with 18" wheels.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was driving an S-line A6 for past 2 years and while it was great it was too big for me. The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV. I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like 'soccer mom' cars until the Q5. That's what made the difference. The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs 'cute'. One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip. My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although a very good looking car and fun to drive at high speeds, this car transmission technology is still too new and Audi has not full control over it, I have a default transmission, and am not the only one, they have no right answers as how to fix it, they first exchange the mechatronics which has nothing to do with the jerking of the transmission in the lower gears, and after trying different things and not being able to repair the car their best solution is to replace the entire transmission in a vehicle that has less than 2800 miles.

<TEXT>My wife in on her second Audi (first an A4, now an A6). I'm the "designated SUV driver" in the family. I had a 5 year old Nissan Murano, which performed well and was a good value, but I've always been jealous of my wife's Audi(s). I looked at several mid-sized SUV's as a replacement, but none compared with the Q5. It drives like a sport sedan, with all of the comfort and convenience of a SUV. The size is perfect for getting around downtown and parking spaces, but it feels very large inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2004 VW Touareg V8 with 125,000 miles. I love this new car. It drives like a dream, a sports car feel with the high ride of an SUV. The interior is simply elegant (I got the Cinnamon brown leather and deep blue exterior), premium plus with Navigation and 19inch wheels. My closest choice was the Volvo XC60, which is also a great car, but the MMI system on the Audi is just, well, cool. The volvo's nav feels very old school and clunky. My only criticism of this car is that when the back seats fold down, there is a gap across the cargo area that a dog's feet could get caught in. Also, the MMI phone system is a dial rather than buttons and plugging in for voicemail is a pain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2009 Prestige Q5 rides like a sport sedan. Great acceleration (especially in sport mode), and responsive steering. I was really surprised on my first all highway trip (approx 75 miles), when I averaged 29.1 mpg! The ride is a bit bumpy on side street streets. Great access to rear storage due to low entry. Seats fold easily. Bang and Olefsun sound system is awesome. The GPS leaves a lot to be desired. The "point of interest's" do not let you choose ANY retail stores. Good luck trying to find nearest Home Depot, Staples, Target, or supermarket- NOT HAPPENING. The restaurant search is a basic listing- can't choose cuisine- Italian, Japanese, etc. My $200 Garmin GPS is far superior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous car was a Subaru 08 STI 5 dr hatch. Speed, agility, utilitarian use best describes our needs. STI proved to be too low for driving on VT pot hole roads. So what was out there that would be fun to drive, quick acceleration, a great solid ride, not too fancy in appearance and interior, yet functional? My friends on facebook submitted their suggestions, this is how I came across the q5! In traffic, great visibility, amazing control maneuvering slow pokes. Quiet. An overall sense of being in your own world with its secure solid build. Great turning into parking spaces. The vehicle drives and feels small. We bought the premium model, base with some options which kept the price down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Q5 after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the last 5 years. I loved my jeep and hated to give it up but the build quality was poor and gas mileage was terrible. I wanted a higher quality vehicle that still could function as a SUV but drove well and offered better gas mileage. The Q5 fits the bill. The Q5 has a high ground clearance and decent cargo room. It handles great and I?ve been getting 25 MPG + at 75 MPH. The cabin is quiet, the seats are comfortable and the visibility is very good. This car provides great car performance with the functionality (functions you use 99% of the time) of a SUV. This is one of the best reviewed luxury SUV?s on the market and I can see why!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Do not buy the MMI Navigation/Audio system unless you enjoy having it on every time you start the vehicle. You have two choices when starting your car. 1) The display comes on and the radio/media begins playing. OR 2) The display comes on with an Audi advertisement screen and the radio/media is off. Trying to blank the Audi advertisement screen causes the radio/media to come back on. You cannot start the car with the display and audio off. This is extremely annoying! I contacted Audi customer care. The representative verified this operation. I was told this operation is normal and they have no plans to fix it. There is no software/firmware update available to address this problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Amazing ride, quality and craftsmanship. Drove the X3 and XC60 and the q5 beats them hands down in all areas. Audi has really done a good job in engineering this car. My only complaint is that Audi should include more standard options on a premium plus. Bang and Olufsen, in my opinion should be standard on a premium plus. Heated seats are standard but currently there isn't an option for Cool/ventilated seats. They get really hot in the summer. For a 40+ thousand dollar car, one would expect more standard options. If there was a option to score on Value, i would give it a 7 or 8 simply because you can find more options for the price in Cadillacs, Lexus, Acura. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery of new Q-5 with Premium/Prestige Packages and immediately set out on 1,200 mile trip. Vehicle performed almost flawlessly. The GPS stopped functioning necessitating the rebooting of the MMI. Q-5 held the road well at speeds to 80mph. Gas mileage averaged a whopping 25mpg. Interior is well appointed. Everything about the Q-5 is solid. The B&O stereo is without equal. This is a great vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love this car. I like the handling and the acceleration. There are a ton of features for the price. The only complaints I have are the gas mileage is kind of poor, and the leather seats are kind of hard and don't really hold you in them very well. The Navigation screen would also be better in a touch screen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Audi and my first cross-over vehicle and I am thoroughly impressed with this car. Looked at a lot of different cars and nothing seemed to have everything I wanted until I drove the Audi. Very good power for a V6, handles well and has a very smooth ride. Great interior, good cargo space and the sunroof is fantastic. I've owned 2 Acuras, a 325 and 525 BMW and a Mercedes (which I'll never buy again), and this car meets and/or exceeds those. Better value for the $$ than the comparable X3 or X5 or Lexus or Mercedes. Better features than the Acura RDX. Really happy with the purchase and I highly recommend the Q5 for anyone looking in this class of cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, this is my first review on a car. I have previously owned 3 Lexus, BMW, Acura, and Toyota's. This is my first Audi, had test drove the A4 when buying Acura and was not impressed, so almost did not even look at the Q5. Glad I did, this IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. Upside, engine is great, street from my house is a hill and a turn against oncoming traffic, the car provides the extra torque in the rear wheel for complete control, ALL other cars has issue with this even BMW 535i also 2009. Interior is extremely nice - I have nearly all the options so car price tag is $50k, which is appears overpriced at first, but when comparing quality interior and options is right on the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The lease for my MB ML320 ended so I did some shopping around. I've tried Acura RDX and MDX and I had serious concern on passenger safety and lack of visibility. The same experience I had with Infiniti. MB GLK is really repulsive in design and BMW is still in the works to replace the outdated X3. Q5 was the best choice that I could have made. The design is outstanding, craftsmanship on the same level. Nice gadgets and the rooftop made my life so easy in convincing my wife: a 10 out of 10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is such a big upgrade from our 2006 X3 (which we loved), I can only begin to describe it. Comfortable, huge acceleration, great steering, excellent visibility. Perfect car for our little family driving around the city. Plenty of room for car seats, strollers, groceries, etc. and looks good enough to bring out for a night on the town. Little nits: side mirrors are too big, auto-dimming rear view mirror dims too often, and brakes are a tad squishy for my taste. But, I love driving this car. Best car we've owned. By far. Including my BMW 328 (blasphemy!). Compared the Volvo XC60, Mazda CX-9, BMW X5, Acura MDX, Lexus RX350: this was a no brainer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent all-around luxury SUV. Traded in our 2004 Volvo XC 90 (transmission problems). Looked at the Volvo XC60 and Lexus RX 350 among several others. After the dealer let us take the demo for a weekend we were sold. The ride is far more superior and has many luxury features in a very attractive package, inside and out. This car is just plain fun to drive and exudes quality. We are getting about 21 mpg overall (majority city driving).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Side assist works beautifully. MMI navigation system is the best on the market and really separated this car from the XC 60. Bang and Olufsen sound system is excellent. Panoramic sun roof is also fantastic. Like the temperature controlled cup holder and keyless entry/start.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Premium Plus w/nav in Ibis White I had never really considered an Audi until I drove the Q5. It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive. Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode (and Triptronic) is where the fun is...0-60 in FAST! MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one.</TEXT>

We test drove the Volvo, Lexus, and MDX. This car was far superior! It was the only one that said, "Buy me"! Everything about it screams quality and luxury. We have been averaging about 19 mpg. I'm sure it would be higher if I could keep my foot out of it! It's just a super fun car to drive! We have the Prestige model--- definitely worth the upgrade!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a Q5 Premium Plus with Navigation. Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want. But Audi is now offering 2.9%, 36 months financing and will make my 1st 2 payments, so net net it is like 0% financing + $500 discount. The car is perfect for my wife. The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK. Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors. My only complaint is the relatively small interior space, especially when compared to RX350. Otherwise, it was perfect. </TEXT>

My local dealership had a hail storm and he was able to get his Q5 repaired and looking new for $8000 off the selling price (not MSRP). At such a deal I bought one also. His is black with tan interior and mine is white with tan interior. We both got the premium plus, but he also got the MMI package. No need for bigger rims or S- line for us. In two weeks he put 1500 miles on his Q5 and could not be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car two months and couldn't be more satisfied. I was regretting handing in my BMX X3 (still love that car) but the Q5 is more luxurious, more comfortable, smoother, better gas mileage, and just as fun to drive. I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23. The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver. The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car. Thru traffic, Manhattan streets, suburban highways and local driving, it gives a consistent and fun-tastic drive. And my passengers have no complaints either. Thanks Audi!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my new Q5 from Audi of Oxnard. I did extensive research prior to the purchase. I wanted all wheel drive for skiing plus a place where both my surfboard and lab dog could fit. I wanted comfort, bluetooth, nav, and pretty much all goodies. The full size moon/ sun roof is a cool addition. I replaced my 06 Acura MDX where the lease just ended. The Audi is extremely comfortable, with fit and finish second to none. Smaller than the mdx, but still o.k. and with better mileage. I got 23.5 on first tank, city and highway.

<TEXT>We've driven the Q5 (with Premium Plus) for a month and we absolutely love it. It's small enough for urban driving/parking, but is roomier and built more intelligently than the X3 that it replaced. Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car. Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads. MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving. My only complaints are that the brakes are a bit squishy and the side view mirrors are huge. This is great for side visibility, but limits front visibility a bit when making turns, for example. I think we'll get used to it.</TEXT>

The Q5 is far better than the Jeep in every way, especially in the snow. We test drove this car during a snow storm and wow, the quattro is amazing. It would not let us fishtail or slide at all, and it just kept us going in a straight line. Aside from that, the MMI is pretty easy to use, the Bang & Olufsen sounds great and the panoramic sunroof is amazing, the whole roof is pretty much glass. Last but not least, the LED's both front and rear look incredible. They were one of the main reasons I bought this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This isn?t going to be your typical car review. This one is taking on a new twist, it?s from the front passengers viewpoint. MS took driving away from me 19 years ago, but I?m still more than able to be the judge of a vehicles stature and quality. Back in 2001 I purchased an Audi Allroad. It was an exceptional car, and always a ?head-turner?. We recently traded it in on a 2009 Q5, and so far we have no regrets. The quality, detail and build is typical Audi?"First-Class". Front seaters well over 6 ft in height have plenty of leg/headroom to spare. The 270hp V6 has enough punch to easily set you back in your seat. The shifting is very smooth and so is the ride. The Q5 also turns heads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an 09 Premium Plus and found the seats to be super uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that I ended up trading it in with only 4,000 miles on it for another '09 A4, but this one had the sport seats (M3-style retractable thigh support bolsters)and better shoulder support plus paddle shifters. Night and day. While I could never get quite comfortable in my Premium Plus I was immediately very comfortable and have been for the past 16,000 miles in my Sport package model. The only issue is that from what I understand Audi has discontinued the "Sport Package" and now only offers the better seats in the S4. Something to consider- you will not like the stock seats if you are 5'10"+.</TEXT>

Acceleration is amazing for any size engine not to mention for a 4 cyl. The Bluetooth integration is excellent as it reads your entire phonebook and makes accessible at your steering wheel controls.

<TEXT>I traded in my 2002 A4 3.0 Quattro on a lease on a 2009 A4 2.0 Quattro. This 2.0 has plenty of torque. Cannot tell the difference with the new V4 from my prior V6, except the gas mileage is better and it is a quieter engine. I ordered the Premium Plus package with the navigator. I love the voice activated bluetooth dialing, the voice activated navigation, etc., and the backup camera with guidance. Audi came up with a winner. I am getting over 33 miles per gallon on the highway and around 28 in the city/suburbs. I am very happy with the vehicle. I loved my 2002; but, this is a big improvement.

<TEXT>Quite frankly, it's hard to be ambivalent about $40k purchase, but I have to be honest with myself, and 9 months after purchasing this car, I can't say it's changed our lives. It's solidly built, but there's a fair amount of road noise. For all the self- congratulation from Audi about the increase in size, it's really not all that roomy. I think my wife's old 2001 Jetta had more room in the back. The MMI might be good compared to options from other manufacturers, but it's hardly intuitive. In sum, it's a solid but not outstanding effort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling: sometimes the size feels awkward, but no matter the situation, you're always in control. Thank you AWD. Also, it's nice that key comes apart so you can take just the metal part with you if you're going for a run or a swim.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The performance is great with sports mode, but the suspension is a bit bumpy for my taste (I can feel every road bump), but I guess that's what you get for a more sports tuned suspension. Fuel economy is not bad for a 211hp AWD car; I'm getting about 30 mpg on the highway and average about 25 highway/city driving. It is definitely a fun to drive car with very tight turning circle. Interior and exterior design earn many praises from my friends. The problem is I'm getting the shimmy around 62 mph (hence points off in reliability) and the diagnosis from Audi Engineering is bad control arms. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that replacing control arms will cure the shimmies.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Audi for 2,500km so far. It is amazing. Fuel efficiency is great for a car with this much power. The 2.0 is more powerful than the 3.2 for the first 100km (60mph). I have the navi and tech pkg. Everything is voice activated. Back up camera is very handy. Proximity sensor locks and engine start are very convenient. EPS is nicely engineered. Audi side assist is handy. Seats are very comfortable. Breaks are high performance. I tested the Lexus IS250 and the BMW 328xi also. I have heard "Hey man nice car!" from over 10 people in 3 weeks. So that covers the exterior design. Red Bull must be more popular in Germany than North America (one of the cup holders is small). </TEXT>

Test drove the 2.0s not going to pay this much for a car that vibrates 3.2 is for me. Brakes are awesome. Keep your eye on the rear view in a panic stop. Tiptronic is fun. Quirks... The ipod interface is poor, I leave my keys in the car in the garage but not with this... the lights will not turn off, the homelink does not work until you turn the car on.

<TEXT>Purchased two days ago and drove over the weekend. Car is beautiful inside and out. Handles like a dream. Very comfortable. Virtually all functions are automated. Using the MMI takes some work, but once you get the hang of the info entry process, it works for most of the different functions. Several reviews stated that someone shorter than 5'4" might have some problems with the driver's seat position. My wife is 5'2" and had no problem getting into a comfortable driving position. Back seat has enough room and the trunk is large for this class of car. I would recommend test driving the 2.0T, as is performs quite well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front seat comfort. Acceleration with the 2.0T is good (for a normal driver anyway). Steering is sharp on hard corners. Lots of gadgets. LED lights are a new wrinkle. Sirus radio and IPOD interface add options for entertainment. Bang and Olfusen stereo systems is well done.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car about 7 months now and no major complaints, except for the wind (see below). The A4 drives well, though it's not quite as responsive as well as my 2006 BMW 5 series. Steering is tight, brakes are just a bit grabby, and power is strong. The AWD is the best, especially in heavy, slushy snow. The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open. Poor wind engineering. And it's difficult to find a good open position of the sunroof so it doesn't make noise. Seems like it has to be readjusted for every speed level.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Both front seats proved to be uncomfortable during long driving periods. The problem is that the seat's side support bolsters are so high and firm (firmer than all other luxury cars of the same class) that they provide undue pressure on the hip bones. The outside side supporting plastic exacerbates the situation by noT allowing any amount of downward give of the seat. Thus, when exiting the vehicle, the plastic support and firm bolster provides undue pressure on legs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up an Aruba Blue,Premium Plus with Navi and wood trim. My wife has a 2009 Cab (older platform) for about a year now. I love driving it so much that I shopped the end of season sales for a sedan for me and found a great deal. I was driving an '04 Accord with 100k trouble-free miles and had no desire to give it up. The Audi's driving dynamics, power and smoothness of the engine are great (even vs. Cab) and gas mileage is quite good. It's also the perfect size I was looking for. The gray interior is beautiful. The MMI is awesome as is the bluetooth and stereo. Seats very comfortable as well. If reliability is on par with the Honda, this will be the best car I've ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine is awesome - much smoother than wife's 2009 Cab and 258 ft. lbs. of torque at only 1500 rpms! Ride is very communicative, comfortable, and quiet.

Quattro provides excellent grip and 2.0T is powerful yet fuel efficient (have gotten 35 mpg cruising). Plus, this car is as big as the Passat I traded in. Some downsides include having to get Prestige to get those stunning 18" wheels and 4 cyl. a little course when revved hard. But overall, I loved my choice for my first luxury brand car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was leased for my wife. I owned a TT with a manual transmission a few years ago and we were attracted to this car by the excellent lease terms, appearance and the previous experience with Audi. The A4 has been back to the dealer twice in 3 weeks. The first time was due to wind noise and a water leak in the space between the front and rear driver's window. That was fixed. The second trip was because the automatic transmission (CVT) feels like it shifts from 1st to overdrive within about 2 seconds, causing significant loss of power. This even happens in sport mode. In addition, there is some lurching and hesitation upon initial acceleration. The dealer says this is "normal".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling...The car feels like it is glued to the road. The steering feel is great and the suspension feels nice and tight. The Cabriolet with the S- Line package looks great. We get a lot of positive comments. Bluetooth works great. Interior fit and finish is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third A4 in four years, passing them on to the kids or trade in on lease. The 2009 Prestige is one sweet machine. Better performance than than older (2006 and 2007 A4) with more torque and horsepower with highway mileage 33 mpg level road at 65-75. Also looked at BMW with AWD but run flats and many thousands more $ just not worth the difference, (and I have had BMW 3 series in the past). Great cruiser at 90 mph and around town. It is bigger than older A4, as big as I can tolerate. $37900 with 0.9% and 1 k down a great deal, than 4200 off MSRP, I will buy it rather than lease.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great looking car and fun drive but has one major flaw. If you attempt to accelerate fast from a dead stop by mashing the accelerator, the transmission hesitates for a full second before the turbo kicks in. This can be dangerous when attempting to make a left turn in front of approaching traffic. I was told by the dealer that this is a common complaint because of the tiptronic transmission and cannot be corrected. You simply cannot throttle the vehicle hard from a stop and there is no fix. They said that I would get used to it. Be sure to test drive the vehicle before purchasing. I only test drove mine for a few miles. </TEXT>

The steering wheel scroll buttons make dialing phone numbers, radio surfing preset stations easy and safe. The daily commute is a 70/30 mix of highway (65-70 mph)and stop-n-go traffic and the Audi delivers an amazing avg 28-31 mpg with mindful throttle (depends on traffic, weather). Despite the 19" wheels and summer perf. tires the ride is firm without being jarring (test before buying). Gorgeous and feature laden.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My car choices when searching came down to the BMW 335 sedan, Lexus GS 350, and the Audi A4. I decided to purchase the A4 based on the features and price. The A4 has the quattro AWD, fold down rear seats, 14 speaker Bang and Olufsen system, bluetooth and navigation. I felt that the exterior styling and the better interior features of the A4 outweighed the engine performance of the 335i. The Lexus rear bumper styling just didn't grow on me. So far after driving the car for the first 1000 miles I am so happy about my decision. The A4 is fast off the line and pulling on the freeway in sports mode, the handling is great with the quattro, and it's very eye catching with the LED driving lights.</TEXT>

The vehicle seems to transmit every nuance of the road surface into the cabin, the seats, and the floor. The suspension is just far, far too firm. Riding on rougher roads is continuously distracting, with tiny road imperfections intruding into an otherwise palatial experience. I urge anyone considering this vehicle to do an extended test drive.

This car is a real standout in the rain, extremely stable which I attribute to the Quattro. Haven't driven it in the snow yet, but I imagine it will perform well.

Even though the sports package moves it further up the performance ladder, the ride is a little too jarring for the road I drive on. An added bonus on this car is fuel frugality.

<TEXT>This is my first Audi purchase after many years of Volkswagen ownership and so far I am loving every mile of it. I chose the Premium Plus and 18" Sport packages. The seats are very comfortable and all controls are easy to use although I find using the MMI creates an extra step to do just about anything except adjust the radio volume. As typical for a German automobile, everything is placed logically. The steering wheel is weighted nicely but the paddles on the back of wheel are too small to make good use of them. I placed my order 10/08 and would have preferred a M/T but the timing just wouldn't work for me to wait that long. Other than that I can't really complain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My trade was a 2006 A3 sport that I had for 2.5 years. I liked it so much I wanted to see what else Audi had that was just a little bit larger, more comfortable yet just as much fun to drive. The A4 Avant Sport was it. Options I got: Premium Plus, Sport, Navigation, Rear Side Airbags. This car is unbelievable. The BMW 325xi wagon cost $8k more for the same equipment but had a cheaper interior and didn't drive as well. The Infiniti EX had sub-par interior quality although it drove great.

Sport suspension gives a firm ride, but still very comfortable and luxurious. Open-sky sunroof is fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Living in the Snowbelt had a dilemma which car to pick. I was looking for manual and 4 wheel drive, turned out that there are not many options available. The instance when I sit- down into Audi, realized that I like this car after the test drive I felt in love with it; signed the contract hour later. If you are looking for great looking comfortable car which can pump the blood through your veins go with A4 manual ? BEST CAR on the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned two 6-cylinder Jaguar X-Types. The Audi A4 ride is fantastic; the 4-cylinder Quattro engine is very powerful. Tiptronic manual shift is fun (but dangerous-- must be careful to avoid speeding ticket)! This vehicle is beautiful, roomy, and hugs the road. Because it's low to the ground you have to be careful when parking, so the front end isn't damaged by concrete barriers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at the Infiniti G37 and BMW 3 series before settling on the Audi A4. Owned an A6 over 10 years ago, and wasn't sure if we we'd buy another Audi, but the A4 has bested all my expectations in the little time I've had it. Didn't need AWD as we have a SUV at home, so I got the FWD with Sport package in Premium Plus trim. Car drives beautifully, hugs the road esp on turns, sounds great, and the LEDs turn heads for sure. The MMI is very easy to learn and the AMI and Bluetooth work like a breeze. The extended length also comes in handy. The next few years will tell me how much they've improved the Reliability but so far so good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've got the diesels and I bought one 3 weeks ago and traded my 2007 BMW 328i. It looks great, the interior is beautiful and the ride is nice and comfortable without being too 'sloppy'. The BMW was my first and last - the ride was horrible. This is as powerful, the auto changes cannot be felt, even in sport mode unless you really look for it - I'm old and like smooth! There is no perfection but this car is excellent in every way. The diesel engine does clatter but you can't really hear it from inside except when you accelerate and then it's only a bit of noise - like noisy tappets on an old car. Great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>...A4, previously owned 2007 2.0T Q sport/Sline/Ti. Current car (2.0TQ prem+ w/sport pkg) is what I was hoping for when I 1st purchased an Audi, slightly better performance than before, much better handling, much improved seats (highly recommend sport pkg option). Feels like an adult's vehicle. Complaints: only re plastic dash piece (hope for aftermarket cure soon) & wish it still had a full size spare - minor stuff really. Very anxious to see how this is chipped, 2007 was a big difference, 2009 promises to be better. Bottom line, I love driving this car... so does my wife.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for about 5000 miles so far, and probably would not buy it again. There's much I truly love about the car but the commuting ride quality on worn roads is very harsh, especially here in New England roads where the car is useful in snow. Since delivery car has real vibration 70 - 80 MPH. I've seen others talk about this, and dealer has not resolved. I plan to take it to an independent tire spot. Speedometer seemed high, and reads about 4-5% higher than actual speed when calibrated with GPS. 77 MPH shows as 80 or 81. Racking up extra miles if you leased! Car is good from stop lights, but 2.0T feels underpowered with highway onramps, etc. Requires "S" mode and a heavy foot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I swapped a Tundra pickup for this wagon and love the car. Best combination of size, performance, and practicality on the market. Wonderful handling and when the turbo kicks in, breathtaking acceleration. Lots of features and techno gadgets even in the base model. As can be expected from Audi, top notch interior build although the gray metallic plastic around the instrument panel seems cheesy, why didn't they just use the aluminum trim like in the rest of the car. The radio controls take some getting used to and the steering wheel audio controls frustratingly don't let you scroll among preset stations only. This car is a looker and gets lots of attention, a top choice among wagons!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Original post- 09/28/08 Car remains a blast to drive- stereo remains a favorite, bi-xenon lights are worth extra money. Significant difference in driving in S mode and super fun on twisting roads. Car handles fantastic in winter (installed winter tires & with all wheel drive - go anywhere as along as snow drifts aren't too high) Car is low - watch out for curbs & cement stops in parking places! Overall am very pleased with purchase after 4 1/2 months driving - you still want to go out just for the heck of it! What could be better - more horsepower (?), ride over bumps could be a bit smoother (but then you'd lose the sports car feel). Just a great car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the A4 with Premium Plus, Nav and the Sport Package in Quartz Grey four months ago. The styling of the A5 caught my attention and when Audi applied it to the A4, it when to the top of my list. Beautiful interior with Aluminum Trim (not cheap plastic like my Chrysler) with plenty of leg room all around and the layout is excellent. The Engine has plenty of power and the brakes are amazing. The ride is a little stiff with the Sport Package and 18" low-profile summer tires, but it tracks around corners fast and flat. Sport seats hold you in place and are comfortable on long trips. Safest car I've ever owned. Thanks to Edmunds for supplying loads of info towards my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After two Corvettes, I decided I needed something more practical but still fun to drive. The Infiniti G37X was a little too small and too stiff and the 328xi a little too expensive. The A4 was just right. It handles well and accelerates nicely with the turbo 4. I don't think the V6 adds much more. It holds 4 people comfortably. I wouldn't go for 5 unless 3 are very small. The trunk is huge. The interior is handsome and the sound system is fine. This is my first experience with BlueTooth and its much better than OnStar.</TEXT>

The interior is beautiful and made with high quality materials. Every button and every dial feels great to the touch. The back seat has enough room for even your biggest family members.

<TEXT>I love to drive this car. It's the Prestige with nav and drive select. The handling is unbelievable, combined with a truly solid ride and plenty of power. I was concerned at first whether the car would have sufficient power for my lead foot, but it certainly does, especially in sport mode. You just need to punch it -- with a turbo, one needs to use more pedal than with a non-turbo 6 cyl. The gadgets are wonderful: Nav, bluetooth, Sirius radio, backup parking beeper and camera. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is fabulous, worth the extra. I took the car on a 3000 mile trip. One barely notices getting to high speed, very solid, esp. with dynamic mode. Radar detector needed!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drive Select-distinct softening in comfort mode, nice for town. Dynamic really tightens up the handling. Sweet on Mulholland Drive with all the other yahoos in their BMW's and Porsches.

I confirm that without ASR, handling is exceeding my expectation! I feared that the electronic would limit my fun, but I'm very pleased by the latitude granted by my A4. And with ASR, I know my wife will not be in trouble when driving in the snow. Also, I got my Ipod cable and can confirm that Ipod integration is flawless. I use playlist and store over 350 CDs on my Ipod. Can navigate with ease and of course, sound quality it excellent.

Compared to my twin turbo 2001 A6, it's a only a bit smaller in the rear seat but very close in the front with more headroom and a larger trunk. While a bit slower of the line to 30, it is faster to 60 than my old twin turbo A6 and definitely a better handler. Have 3000 miles already and just got back from a 1500 mile trip. Very comfortable despite a somewhat stiffer seat than the A6. Overall, very pleased.</TEXT>

End of story. The handling could not get any better; it is even better than the 2008 Audi A4. The steering is very precise and adapts to how fast or slow you are going. The ride is quiet and smooth, making it a very comfortable car. I could see myself sticking with Audis in the future. Even though the price can be high for some buyers, all I have to say is take a test drive and you will see that you get what you pay for. The car is amazing. I would not change a thing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 A4 Quattro with Premium Plus less then one month ago and I simply can't stop driving this vehicle. It's fun to drive. Turns heads (Daytime Running lights). Simply looks great! Awesome build quality. That is just the start of the reason I love this vehicle. As usual the folks from Audi have done an outstanding job of designing and building this vehicle. The tolerances are very tight, the materials are high quality, and overall design theme is stunning. I've never really been excited about a vehicle until this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Audi Music Interface works great, the Ipod integration is fantastic as is the bluetooth connectivity for cell phones. I love how my contacts are downloaded right into the vehicle so I can easily dial without ever lifting my hands from the wheel. My favorite feature? All of it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned various BMW's & Audi's over the past 15 years, and this seems to be one of my favorites. I just ended an X3 lease and was considering the 328xi wagon or the A4 Avant. To my surprise, I chose the Avant with the Premium Plus Package, because they really made a lot of advancements since my 2004 Audi. Until BMW redesigns the 328, the Audi 2.0 I think is a much better car. It handles great, it's feels much quicker than the 328, and the interior and exterior design (at least on the Avant) is a real winner. So far, I think it's a no brainer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MMI is very cool. The 2.0 is much better than I thought it would be. Handling is very crisp. I can really throw it through turns. Seats are very comfortable. Seems to get pretty good gas mileage. Finally, being a wagon, there's lots of cargo space. Why would anybody choose an SUV</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked it up 2 weeks ago in Aruba Blue. Love the car and the color. I test drove several cars before decided on A4. You can't compare beautiful interior & exterior designing with any other car in its class. When turbo kicks in you feel you are drving on the race track not on a highway. Love the MMI, bluetooth and iPod features. I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great pick up, awesome interior, great sound system & MMI.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had this car for three weeks and I have nothing but good things too say about it. Stylish exterior with just as beautiful interior. Acceleration and power feel much better than when I tested the 2009 TSX which is also a four-banger but not quite as responsive as the other competitors that have a V6. Safety is pretty much on par with everyone else as well but Quattro is a big plus since that's the only real fulltime AWD in its class. I like that automatic not only has a manual shift mode, but also a sport autoshift that lets the car stay in lower gears longer for more power. All in all a real eye-catcher inside and out that gets decent MPG for an AWD and has just enough zip to have fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All new styling and increased HP, torque, MPG, and room than the old model. Trunk also big enough to fit my golf clubs and much much more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car for 3 weeks and 600 miles of driving so far. I got the Premium Plus trim with Navigation and I'm really loving the car. It has the exterior looks, interior styling/finish and performance that make it the true triple-threat. For a V4 turbo, it delivers a consistent torque through the RPM range making it a pure joy to drive coupled with the excellent all- time quattro AWD. The interior is Audi at it's best with an excellent MMI system - for all intents and purposes is the same interior of the more expensive A6/Q7 models. Everything is designed to make the driver's job as effortless and enjoyable as possible and I have no regrets whatsoever in purchasing this car. Recommended</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance of 2.0T engine is excellent while still giving great gas mileage. Interior styling, finish and technology is same as more expensive A6/Q7 model. The LED DRLs are unique and attention grabbing, add personal flair to the car. Rain sensing wipers/auto headlights make effortless driving</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased the new A4- significant improvements over previous generation. Tested Mercedes C class, BMW 3 series, Infinti G35, Lexus IS before deciding on Audi. Vehicle has premium pckg, Technology pckg, B&O stereo system. All options worth the extra cost- stereo is wonderful, MMI much easier and intuitive than BMW, steering is very crisp, engine is very good, transmission very smooth, shifting in manual mode is great! As expected, interior is best in class and extra length to car has resulted in much better back seat space than previous versions- tall people will still find back a bit cramped though. Save money + stay with base engine- turbo is great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, transmission, steering, brakes are all great. Stereo is awesome- car looks great (white/black) and new headlights work and look great! Seats are comfortable as well</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been researching the '09 A4 since March 08 - I ordered it in July and picked it up 2 weeks ago. The car is everything I'd hoped for. It is beautifully redesigned with a sportier & elegant lines. The headlights are making heads turn on the road!! The trunk is spacious; interior is luxurious and roomy. I debated on waiting for the 6-speed manual, but decided to go with the 6-speed tiptronic. The response is quick with a very smooth shifting; excellent acceleration. I have the premium plus package with navigation/back up camera option. There are abundant features included in the premium plus package; I also added the navigation package which included the MMI.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MMI: I love the interface which controls the bluetooth, iPod (Audi Music Interface), navigation and audio selections. Best part is I don't even have to take my phone out of my bag. It picks up the contacts in my Blackberry so I can dial right from the MMI!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wish this car had better MPG. That's my only complaint so far. It's competitive with others, but I'm finding closer to 26/27 on the highway versus 30/31 as dealerships tend to suggest you'll get, rather than the numbers listed on the window. Then again, who trusts car dealerships. I find the front seat very very comfortable and since I do a lot of highway driving, this is a big plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Of course my car is new and I'm so happy and exited about my choice; but I did test all AWD cars in that segment, then chose A4 for the style, size (bmw too small), quality of the interior, ultimate sound system. Handling, fun to drive is great! Performance is more than enough for me, but lack brute force of G35x or BMW335xi. This is the only item for which the A4 is not getting perfect score across the board. B&O sound system is a marvel! Way superior than previous Bose option. And with the SD card support, I even don't need to use CD (6 disk changer, MP3 support). It comes with ipod integration, I'm expecting the ipod cable delivery soon and will provide feedback on it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy for a 6cyl, it's great! Handling in corners. Sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new A4 is an all around excellent auto. It surpasses all others in its class and then some. Wheelbase is similar to the MBenz E-class. Style is literally a jaw dropper. Acceleration 0-60 is better than my 225hp TT which was 6.3 sec. Im guessing the A4 3.2 quattro is similar to the A5 3.2 rating of 5.8sec 0-60, not the 6.3 posted on the Audi website. The exhaust sound is deep and throaty. Braking is quick with minimal nose dive. The best feature is the steering feel. It's very light and nimble. Interior and exterior finish quality is top notch. I test drove this car at Infineon raceway a few months ago and couldn't wait for its arrival. A well equipped A4 3.2 quattro for $40k, what a deal!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The A4 3.2 quattro is fully loaded and well worth the extra $4k. Seats are heated and/or cooled. The LED daytime driving lights are a big attention grabber. The best feature is the steering response.</FAVORITE>
