9/27/2009,appetites1,"Have all the toys in this car, have driven 7000 miles to date. Owned many cars in my 50 years of driving and this is by far the best. Enough performance and great quiet and comfort. Very smooth in every way. Getting 25+ mpg with no problems to date. If I could build it myself I would trade the mmi for touch screen nav, make the manual a little tighter shifting, but overall the best ride my wife and I ever had! ",smooth & quiet
8/18/2009,Joanne,"I've had my 2009 A5 for two months now, and I continue to be delighted every time I take it out of my garage, I feel like a child with a new toy. I'm pampered by the amenities such as the excellent back-up camera, the i- pod integration system, the crisp 6- speed shifter, and the amazingly comfortable seats. I love the screen over the sunroof, which allows a little light but not enough to make me squint against the sun. The exterior styling is quietly elegant - the daytime running lights are cooler than I can say, and I love the keyless entry which keeps me from digging in my purse for my keys. I routinely get 33 mpg on the highway.","The lovely black glossy finish. The easy-to-use nav system. The comfortable seats. The acceleration of the 6-speed transmission. All- wheel drive - a ""must-have"" in North Dakota. My bicycle fits in the back!"
7/13/2009,mgd99,"I held onto my 1998 A4 for 11 years, before getting the A5 S-Line 3.2 MT in early May. I was looking for something sportier, but with the same quattro like 4WD since I live in CT and I like the feel of quattro on a snow covered highway. The A5 has been a dream. The looks and fit of the exterior is exceptional. The interior is remarkable for its price range. The 265HP is completely sufficient to address the 98% of my driving. I got Drive Select and it feels like two different cars in one. Best yet, so few of these on the road and people regularly proffer estimates of $75k. You want a daily driver that satisfies a need for sport without spending a small fortune? This is it.","Exterior style (German with an Italian flair), S-line style in particular. Interior style and fit (befits a $100k car). Audi Drive Select ($2k gets you the equivalent of 2 different car personalities)"
6/2/2009,Aks,"Pros: Led lights, B&O Sound System, Exterior, Interior, MPG, all wheel drive, Trunk space, Great resale value and MMI console. Cons: Expensive, Navigation package is not that great when compared to other luxury brands and not much head room. Overall this is an AWESOME Coupe!!! ","LED Lights, all wheel drive"
6/2/2009,joe in ri,"Chose the A5 for its beauty and refinement. No disappointments as it has exceeded our expectations. Our 2nd Audi as we need awd and like the quality furnishings. But this baby has smooooth power and delivering 25+ mpg so far. Chose select drive, tech package and nav and all works delightfully. The 6 sp manual works flawlessly with plenty of torque in every gear.","side assist, bluetooth and voice command, drop dead gorgeous looks, smooth, quiet and comfortable, exceptional fuel economy"
6/1/2009,Ted,"I am 6'5"" tall and need a car I can fit in. Rented an Audi A5 in Italy in January 2009 and fit great so shopped for one back home in California. Test drove the A5 and loved it. But liked the S-Line meteor gray looks much better so bought that one. Am loving it. So much fun to drive and there is enough head room. Not much visibility behind, but with the rear video camera and warning sounds, and side mirror driver assist-really don't need the visibility. Quiet ride, fun to drive, and I get many random compliments in parking lots. Only really bad thing is that I hate the lumbar on the sporty seats. Cannot get a comfortable position. Big bump in my lower back. No other seat does this. ","Interior and Exterior looks, quiet smooth ride, quick acceleration, fun to drive, dash display, night time panel lights, Bang Olufsen stereo. "
5/20/2009,Tommy,"After 3 months I still look back at it and smile, the lines are great, the LED lights are AWESOME!! Being 1 of 3 in my area an S5 nothing to say about that, but the other A5 has the basic, if u can spend the money get the upgrades 19"", B&O system and as I'm reading the reviews the standard leather isn't good, I have the Milano and can't complain. I will say seat positioning is hard to find, but i haven't found a car that makes it easy! I also have the Dynamic Control. If u like to be aggressive sometimes it's worth it, the car totally changes under you (Trans, Suspen, Handle) and I have to say, for the small HRS power I have knocked out some pretty beefed up cars when I hit that button.","LIGHTS!!!! The sound, it's so clear - the ipod connection. The fact that there are so few on the streets. ~All in ALL the car itself~~"
4/27/2009,SLINE,"It's fun, the roof needs to open, I mean really for that much money Audi could do much better. It barely tilts. I only have 200 miles on it and already am looking for something else... A lot of money but no great things... Dash is very clumsy in design, not very user friendly, and if you buy one don't even thing of trying to adjust anything on the dash board you will wreck your new baby...","Styling, S-Line is the only way to go..."
3/22/2009,Laura,"The body of this car is by far the best looking on the road today. And Deep Sea Blue is the most beautiful color I?ve seen. In the shade it looks black, but in the sunlight it?s a gorgeous three dimensional metallic shade of dark blue. I think the darker colors bring out the lines better than the lighter ones, but I?ve read other reviews that say the opposite. The conclusion: the car has awesome lines regardless of color. The MMI isn?t as confusing as some reviews say; however, most actions are a two-step process. It?s a little more work, but there are SO many options for comfort, information, entertainment, etc. If you?re considering this car, go drive one, you?ll love it. ","Color and style are stunning. I absolutely love Side Assist for highway driving. Bang & Olufsen Sound w/Sirius & ipod interface is the best around. Everything just speaks elegance. With the manual trans, it?s the perfect blend of sports car and class."
3/14/2009,Drew,"After 8 months, I am still thrilled with the car. I have never owned a car that got so much attention from so many people. It has enough power to make it fun to drive, and the Quattro all-wheel drive is fun to challenge in corners.","I-Pod function is seamless with the MMI controls, bluetooth phone connection works great, and LED running lights are a stunning accent!"
2/21/2009,Vegas,"For the money, one of the best cars I have owned. I have received so much interest from other drivers whether driving it or walking up and people stopping to inquire. Driving impression for such a heavy car is terrific and well balanced. The all wheel drive and 19 inch wheels no doubt compensate. One reviewer complained about the steering. I don't see it. I have not heard rattle, squeak or shutter. The fit and build quality is tremendous. Plus, you're not seeing yourself coming down the road in a 3 series. The v6 has great power. The V8 blows you away, but so does the gas. Great car. ","Exterior design, parking assist, Hamon Kardon Audio."
2/5/2009,david,"Shopped long and hard and considered BMW3 and Z4, Mercedes C300 and SLK, Infiniti G37, Cadillac CTS and Audi TT. In my opinion, the A5 offered the best combination of style,performance, comfort and value and I have not been disappointed after four months and 5000 miles. MPG of 20.3 with estimated 20% highway/80% city. Plenty of room for two sets of golf clubs in the spacious trunk. I enjoy the look of the 19"" Y wheels but would not recommend them to those of you that do the majority of your driving on the highway due to a rougher ride. Minor nitpicks for excessive brake dust (although it appears to be moderating) and for a slight roughness when shifting from second to third.","Overall elegance both inside and out. The rich dark hue of the Deep Sea Blue paint at twilight. Six speed manual and, of course, the B & O premium sound system cranking out Serius Blues."
1/13/2009,dillon,"Traded in 2000 BMW 328i. Had always planned on replacing with another BMW but I haven't been impressed with the current designs and decided to make the switch. Looked at a number of cars in this segment but ultimately choose the A5 for the practicality of the AWD, decent MPG, and of course the stunning looks (don't buy this car if you don't like being gawked at). Acceleration and handling are good but there are certainly cars with better. Got to test out the Quattro last month in some serious snow and ice... and it was unbelievable. For me it was all about being able to drive in the winter. If that's not an issue than I think the competition is stiff for the A5.",LED daytime running lights- soon they'll be ubiquitous but for now quite exotic looking (wish I could see them when I'm driving). Technology package- Side Assist and Smart key. Huge trunk. MMI is surprisingly easy to learn. 
1/8/2009,Robert,"After drooling for this car for the better part of a year, I finally ordered the car last July. Unfortunately, due to availability issues, I was unable to drive the configuration I ordered (18"" tires, M/T). The car's ride and handling easily surpassed my expectations (as well as my previous 2002 A4 w/ sport suspension. Engine is silky smooth, with a light clutch but excellent feedback. The car is extremely quiet, and combined with the Bang & Olfsen radio, just a pure joy to drive",Quattro. 
11/15/2008,dug,"I finally traded in my 2001 BMW 330 for this car and although it is a nice car, I miss the BMW just a bit. The long wheelbase makes navigating in tight situations tough and the standard leather feels really cheap. Wish I would have paid for the leather upgrade. Also, wish it came standard with the S-line seats. The standard seats feel a little too flat and make it tough to really have fun with the car. Don't get me wrong, this car is sweet. It is awesome to drive and the performance definitely rivals a BMW. Much cheaper than the 335 coupe too. Really like the technology controls and the B&O sound system rocks. Tough to go wrong. Wish I had more money to buy the upgrades.","Styling, interior controls, sound system, smooth ride, fun to drive, highway acceleration. Manual transmission started off a little rough but drives like a dream now after three weeks. Lots of room inside and trunk is huge. Interior styling feels nice, not much hard plastic."
11/13/2008,GirlAroundTown,"2009 A5 S line with all the bells and whistles. My 3rd Audi. Bought after my 1st Benz that I got ripped off from my G35 coupe trade in. Still breaking it though so I will get back after a few months for a full review. Didn't do the drive mode button though...waste of money. Still trying to get used to seat position, haven't found perfect yet. Shame it doesn't have as much power as the G37 with the V6. I would have went with the lower powered turbo instead or diesel if an option here in the US.",B&O sound system. Stitch work on seats for S line. Exterior design. Headlamps are by far the coolest on the street. Being one of only 2 A5 drivers in Jacksonville is fantastic. 
11/10/2008,drblue,"I own an A5 S-Line version in red. I love it after stepping down from a 1997 A8. The car was worth waiting for and it is really a large sport car. This thing handles like a dream, but if it didn't have 19 in wheels with summer tires the ride wouldn't feel so brutal over bad pavement. The combination velour and leather seats are firm and supportive, a good thing for spirited driving. These seats are not as cushy as the A8, but this is a different beast. I like the driving position so much that I have changed my position in other cars to replicate the position. The trunk is only 3 cubic feet less than the A8, this means it is huge (about 16 cubic ft).","Bang & Olufsen sound, handling, trunk size, driving position, engine, voice commands, MMI/navigator, exterior styling. There is an interface for an iPod. In dash 6-disc CD player. I like the redundant steering wheel controls. Bluetooth, voice command controls are appreciated."
10/31/2008,steve,"This is the most fun car I have ever owned. My last car was a BMW 335 and the power and acceleration of the A5 is just as good. I read some reviews saying this car lacked acceleration power, so I drove test drove both the manual and the automatic. The difference was night and day. For anyone who wants a serious sports car with amazing handling, I would recommend the manual version of the A5- -while the automatic is nice, the manual drives and feels much more like the S5, but about 10K less expensive. I was considering the BMW X6, but the A5 was more fun to drive with much better gas mileage. Seriously, forget the tiptronic--only about $1200 more for auto, but a downgrade in my opinion.",Manual transmission with sportline package. Awesome front and rear grille.
10/30/2008,Gulfstream,"Amazing value. I've owned a 911Cab, 535i, SL55AMG and CL500 in the past 5 years. Ridiculous yes but I like cars. None of these come close to my new loaded '09 A5 for the dollar. Yes, the SL55 had the power & torque but not the value or the back seat for kids. I also drove the S5 but glad I bought the A5 instead with drive select. Sometimes I want the 911 handling and other times the Lexus sofa. With DriveSelect, its your decsion and it all works! I predict MB, BMW and Lexus will lose market share to Audi over the next few years and rightfully so. ""Car of the Year"" ...if you can find one.","The B & O system is absolutely the best car audio I've ever heard. Radio, NAV, ipod & blue tooth integration are flawless! Arm rest slides fwd with adjustable height to match shifter elevation. Large boot. With 500 miles on car in last 2 weeks, I have no regrets."
10/30/2008,Adam,"This has been a hectic journey. Ten months, and three different A5 orders, I got my Audi. I originally opted for a Deep Sea Blue A5, but I settled for Brilliant Black. All I can say is wow. At just about every stop-light, I will get stares are looks from other drivers.When I go to a restaurant, valet will park me in the front. When I get into my car with the intelligent key, I am relaxed by the Bang & Olufson sound system. In terms of safety, I don't think you can get much better. Rear backup camera, tons of airbags, and sticky tires which prevent me from sliding. Overall, I do not regret going from a 2006 325xi to this car. I highly do not regret leaving the BMW Brand. I am happy I bought it.","Looks, cinnamon milano leather, plenty of standard features, an excellent navigation interface, a pretty good value, attractive standard rims, technology package (well worth the money), B & O sound system, quality inside and out, a good alternative to the far too common 3 series coupe"
9/24/2008,Hinks,"I had a 2008 A5 on order, but fortunately I delayed the order so I could get a 2009. Worth the wait. I traded a RS6 and am far happier. Don't feel like I gave up much performance (yes, I drove the S5 also) but the gained a 50% or better increase in mileage. Handling is the best of any Audi I've owned. Car is beautiful and I have gotten more compliments on the car than I had with the Porsche Carerra. The '09 has the Audi sensors on the side mirrors that show a warning light for traffic in your blind spot. There is on the fly control of steering, suspension, and shift characteristics from gentle to aggresive. iPod combined with B & O sound is fantastic with no distortion at full volume. ","The 2009 has voice activation and it is a joy to use. No problems with it understanding me from the git go. Can call up a radio station by name, including going from the traffic report on AM to the oldies in Sirius with a single request. Can call up nav, ask for it to find a gas station by voice. "
9/17/2008,ckeck,"This car is simply amazing all around. Comes with a nice price tag, but definitely worth every last penny. Exterior styling and especially interior fit/finish are top notch. The performance for V6 is quite good and the Quattro really makes you stick to the road. Its really nice not having to worry about the back- end getting away from you. I get so many looks in this car I'm afraid a few people haven't wrecked looking at it because they stare so long. Overall, I give this car a solid 10, it is everything I thought it would be and more!","S-Line wheels, drive select, manual trans"
9/7/2008,DSB A5,"I had test drives in the G37, TT and A5 and had to think long and hard on what was a very difficult choice. The A5 finally won me over with its fabulous lines matched perfectly to a class leading interior and Audi build quality. I'm giving up a 2003 BMW 330ci which I really love for this car. I came to the conclusion that there comes a time in life when it's not the fastest 0-60 time that matters. The A5 is responsive enough for me (although the D position is pretty woeful for spirited driving) in sport or manual shift mode. Driving home from the dealership (83 miles) with the A5 was a joy. Long distance cruising in this car is a pleasure. Sound insulation is excellent with 18"" wheels.",The Deep Sea Blue Pearl exterior and Cinnamon Brown Milano leather interior are a perfect combination. Push button start and convenience key are great. A practical boot that can accommodate real world luggage and carrying requirements. B & O sound system. 
8/26/2008,JT,"This is my first coupe and my first Audi. I picked up the car two weeks ago after waiting ten weeks from order to delivery. The car is absolutely beautiful inside and out, is fun to drive and very quite on the highway. Audi really got it right with this design.","Everything, especially the Bang & Olufsen sound system."
10/20/2009,coloradodriver,"I purchased an 09 Premium Plus and found the seats to be super uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that I ended up trading it in with only 4,000 miles on it for another '09 A4, but this one had the sport seats (M3-style retractable thigh support bolsters)and better shoulder support plus paddle shifters. Night and day. While I could never get quite comfortable in my Premium Plus I was immediately very comfortable and have been for the past 16,000 miles in my Sport package model. The only issue is that from what I understand Audi has discontinued the ""Sport Package"" and now only offers the better seats in the S4. Something to consider- you will not like the stock seats if you are 5'10""+.","Sport seats on the sport model, paddle shifters, bluetooth."
10/20/2009,Adrian Pineda,"I've had this car for almost a month with 1300 miles on it. It is an awesome car with excellent driving dynamics. I can hardly believe it is a 4 cylinder, but I'm reminded of it when I idle the engine with the windows down. I returned a leased 2007 Lexus IS350 and at no point did I feel like I downgraded although this vehicle was $7000 less. The interior room is cavernous and the ergonomics are superb. Acceleration is amazing for any size engine not to mention for a 4 cyl. The Bluetooth integration is excellent as it reads your entire phonebook and makes accessible at your steering wheel controls. The front end with the LED Running lights makes this car spell luxury.","LED Running lights, Exterior/interior, Ipod & bluetooth integrations, AWD handling, MPG/performance ratio, turning ratio, overall dimensions (it is a massive, confident vehicle). QUIET ride at all speeds! My coworker bought one after he test drove mine."
9/25/2009,Bob,"I traded in my 2002 A4 3.0 Quattro on a lease on a 2009 A4 2.0 Quattro. This 2.0 has plenty of torque. Cannot tell the difference with the new V4 from my prior V6, except the gas mileage is better and it is a quieter engine. I ordered the Premium Plus package with the navigator. I love the voice activated bluetooth dialing, the voice activated navigation, etc., and the backup camera with guidance. Audi came up with a winner. I am getting over 33 miles per gallon on the highway and around 28 in the city/suburbs. I am very happy with the vehicle. I loved my 2002; but, this is a big improvement. Only thing I miss from the 2002 is the storage compartments under the front seats.","Bluetooth phone, navigator, and radio can be controlled by voice. Very smart looking dash and console. The extra room from the previous model makes a noticeable difference."
9/16/2009,pjl275,"We get many compliments on our S-Line Cab. Great looking S4 wheels. This is our first convertible and we love top down driving. The Cab is fun to drive but not BMW thrilling. Like the fact its an AWD car, for full year use. Fit and finish is excellent, interior is gorgeous. Gas mileage is terrible. Hope long term reliability is good. We leased, but buyout is very attractive. If it holds together, can envision a long term ownership.","Style, interior design and finish. Wheels look great. Love the way the car looks with the top and windows down."
9/9/2009,JK,"Fun to drive in country roads, especially with S mode. The exterior with daylight running light draws attentions and the interior design, especially with the red back lights, is just beautiful. The fuel economy is good with over 33 mpg highway and 27 mixed highway/city driving.","Quattro, exterior, interior, bluetooth phone interface, ipod music interface, daylight running light."
9/5/2009,ab,"Quite frankly, it's hard to be ambivalent about $40k purchase, but I have to be honest with myself, and 9 months after purchasing this car, I can't say it's changed our lives. It's solidly built, but there's a fair amount of road noise. For all the self- congratulation from Audi about the increase in size, it's really not all that roomy. I think my wife's old 2001 Jetta had more room in the back. The MMI might be good compared to options from other manufacturers, but it's hardly intuitive. In sum, it's a solid but not outstanding effort.","The handling: sometimes the size feels awkward, but no matter the situation, you're always in control. Thank you AWD. Also, it's nice that key comes apart so you can take just the metal part with you if you're going for a run or a swim."
9/2/2009,JK,"The performance is great with sports mode, but the suspension is a bit bumpy for my taste (I can feel every road bump), but I guess that's what you get for a more sports tuned suspension. Fuel economy is not bad for a 211hp AWD car; I'm getting about 30 mpg on the highway and average about 25 highway/city driving. It is definitely a fun to drive car with very tight turning circle. Interior and exterior design earn many praises from my friends. The problem is I'm getting the shimmy around 62 mph (hence points off in reliability) and the diagnosis from Audi Engineering is bad control arms. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that replacing control arms will cure the shimmies.","Stereo, Audi Music Interface (ipod interface), quattro, sports mode, bluetooth hands-free phone interface, interior material and exterior looks, day light running lights."
8/14/2009,ca,"I've had the Audi for 2,500km so far. It is amazing. Fuel efficiency is great for a car with this much power. The 2.0 is more powerful than the 3.2 for the first 100km (60mph). I have the navi and tech pkg. Everything is voice activated. Back up camera is very handy. Proximity sensor locks and engine start are very convenient. EPS is nicely engineered. Audi side assist is handy. Seats are very comfortable. Breaks are high performance. I tested the Lexus IS250 and the BMW 328xi also. I have heard ""Hey man nice car!"" from over 10 people in 3 weeks. So that covers the exterior design. Red Bull must be more popular in Germany than North America (one of the cup holders is small).

8/13/2009,stanhope,"Turbo 4 provides plenty acceleration with good gas mileage. Handling is unreal. Considered the BMW 328 and Cadillac CTS. Both were great but did not appear worth the extra cost (insurance, maintenance and purchase price). ","Handling, interior and overall dealer service."
8/11/2009,JJM,"Car is everything I expected. Fit & Finish is as good as it gets. So good in fact that the seams trunk to body are so tight you can't fit bike rack clips in between. Engine is smooth. Test drove the 2.0s not going to pay this much for a car that vibrates 3.2 is for me. Brakes are awesome. Keep your eye on the rear view in a panic stop. Tiptronic is fun. Quirks... The ipod interface is poor, I leave my keys in the car in the garage but not with this... the lights will not turn off, the homelink does not work until you turn the car on. Kinda dumb that you start the car before you open the garage door. ",Great stability & Ride
9/17/2008,Simon0809,"This by far has been the best experience in any of the cars I have driven. The car has a lot of speed for a 4 cyl and also it has a sport gear. The interior is really comfortable, and I so far have not had any blind spots! Could not ask for more in a car! ","Sunroof is neat, I love the headlights, and the heated seats will look forward to when winter comes around! The radio is also very impressive. "
9/15/2008,anchor5072,"Purchased two days ago and drove over the weekend. Car is beautiful inside and out. Handles like a dream. Very comfortable. Virtually all functions are automated. Using the MMI takes some work, but once you get the hang of the info entry process, it works for most of the different functions. Several reviews stated that someone shorter than 5'4"" might have some problems with the driver's seat position. My wife is 5'2"" and had no problem getting into a comfortable driving position. Back seat has enough room and the trunk is large for this class of car. I would recommend test driving the 2.0T, as is performs quite well. ",Front seat comfort. Acceleration with the 2.0T is good (for a normal driver anyway). Steering is sharp on hard corners. Lots of gadgets. LED lights are a new wrinkle. Sirus radio and IPOD interface add options for entertainment. Bang and Olfusen stereo systems is well done.
8/10/2009,Danny,"I've had the car about 7 months now and no major complaints, except for the wind (see below). The A4 drives well, though it's not quite as responsive as well as my 2006 BMW 5 series. Steering is tight, brakes are just a bit grabby, and power is strong. The AWD is the best, especially in heavy, slushy snow. The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open. Poor wind engineering. And it's difficult to find a good open position of the sunroof so it doesn't make noise. Seems like it has to be readjusted for every speed level.","Love the look, styling and stunning daytime running lights. Very supportive seats on those long drives. Trunk holds lots of stuff."
8/6/2009,datunlu,"I had the 06 A4. The 09 model is much bigger, for a tall guy like me, a great improvement. The LED light and the media control really made my decision much easier (we were choosing among Audi, BMW, MB, and Volvo). Best value for its class. It has been a month since we got it, we liked everything.","LED light, Audi media interface, better arranged control buttons, and the spacious interior."
8/2/2009,JB,"Both front seats proved to be uncomfortable during long driving periods. The problem is that the seat's side support bolsters are so high and firm (firmer than all other luxury cars of the same class) that they provide undue pressure on the hip bones. The outside side supporting plastic exacerbates the situation by noT allowing any amount of downward give of the seat. Thus, when exiting the vehicle, the plastic support and firm bolster provides undue pressure on legs. ",Very responsive and typical teutonic design.
8/2/2009,mynewaudi,I've had my Audi A4 for one week now. Excellent well designed car. Sharp styling with excellent design/fit and finish on the interior. MMI is really slick. Performance on the 2.0T is excellent - strong pull due to high torque. No problems with the CVT thus far. Exhaust note gives a good growl when accelerating. Pricing right now has been really good too!,"Interior design, fit & finish and performance"
7/31/2009,Hans,"Just picked up an Aruba Blue,Premium Plus with Navi and wood trim. My wife has a 2009 Cab (older platform) for about a year now. I love driving it so much that I shopped the end of season sales for a sedan for me and found a great deal. I was driving an '04 Accord with 100k trouble-free miles and had no desire to give it up. The Audi's driving dynamics, power and smoothness of the engine are great (even vs. Cab) and gas mileage is quite good. It's also the perfect size I was looking for. The gray interior is beautiful. The MMI is awesome as is the bluetooth and stereo. Seats very comfortable as well. If reliability is on par with the Honda, this will be the best car I've ever owned.","Engine is awesome - much smoother than wife's 2009 Cab and 258 ft. lbs. of torque at only 1500 rpms! Ride is very communicative, comfortable, and quiet. MMI is very good, even though it is slightly more tedious than Honda's. Bluetooth works great with both of my phones. Interior is beautiful. "
7/20/2009,cyberalAL,"This car is simply stunning, especially from the outside, especially with the Prestige package I got. Handling is very balanced, ride is sporty yet comfortable for longer commutes. Quattro provides excellent grip and 2.0T is powerful yet fuel efficient (have gotten 35 mpg cruising). Plus, this car is as big as the Passat I traded in. Some downsides include having to get Prestige to get those stunning 18"" wheels and 4 cyl. a little course when revved hard. But overall, I loved my choice for my first luxury brand car.","MMI easy to use, Audi Music Interface, daytime LED eyeliner lights, exterior styling, Bang & Olufsen stereo, Bluetooth phone hookup."
7/15/2009,JWS,"This car was leased for my wife. I owned a TT with a manual transmission a few years ago and we were attracted to this car by the excellent lease terms, appearance and the previous experience with Audi. The A4 has been back to the dealer twice in 3 weeks. The first time was due to wind noise and a water leak in the space between the front and rear driver's window. That was fixed. The second trip was because the automatic transmission (CVT) feels like it shifts from 1st to overdrive within about 2 seconds, causing significant loss of power. This even happens in sport mode. In addition, there is some lurching and hesitation upon initial acceleration. The dealer says this is ""normal"".",Handling...The car feels like it is glued to the road. The steering feel is great and the suspension feels nice and tight. The Cabriolet with the S- Line package looks great. We get a lot of positive comments. Bluetooth works great.

The day after I bought it, it had a check engine light on. 3 trips to the dealership in a month and a half later, I got the fuel pump replaced. I'm hoping this problem doesn't continue because I really do love the car. I feel I should relate my experience to others so they can be informed buyers, though. Aside from this inconvenience, I really do like my car. ","Navigation with backup camera is the BEST! It's saved me from dings and dents already. It forces me to pay closer attention when I back up. Also, I love the design of the multimedia interface and the quality of the leather seats, etc... It just seems more stylish than competitors'."

Better performance than than older (2006 and 2007 A4) with more torque and horsepower with highway mileage 33 mpg level road at 65-75. Also looked at BMW with AWD but run flats and many thousands more $ just not worth the difference, (and I have had BMW 3 series in the past). Great cruiser at 90 mph and around town. It is bigger than older A4, as big as I can tolerate. $37900 with 0.9% and 1 k down a great deal, than 4200 off MSRP, I will buy it rather than lease.","overall styling mileage, media interface"
6/28/2009,Guy Coates,"This is a great looking car and fun drive but has one major flaw. If you attempt to accelerate fast from a dead stop by mashing the accelerator, the transmission hesitates for a full second before the turbo kicks in. This can be dangerous when attempting to make a left turn in front of approaching traffic. I was told by the dealer that this is a common complaint because of the tiptronic transmission and cannot be corrected. You simply cannot throttle the vehicle hard from a stop and there is no fix. They said that I would get used to it. Be sure to test drive the vehicle before purchasing. I only test drove mine for a few miles. ","Once the turbo kicks in, the car accelerates extremely fast and handles great on curves. I love the looks of the car and enjoy all the other features. The trunk is huge. The daytime running lights are unique. Gas mileage is great. "
6/25/2009,S-Line Pilot,"The commute has gotten a lot more pleasant since the A4 S-Line came in. The Audi is quiet, comfortable, and effortlessly easy to drive. The Alcantara seats are cooler than full leather in hot Louisiana summers. MMI is easy to use and useful after very short learning curve. The steering wheel scroll buttons make dialing phone numbers, radio surfing preset stations easy and safe. The daily commute is a 70/30 mix of highway (65-70 mph)and stop-n-go traffic and the Audi delivers an amazing avg 28-31 mpg with mindful throttle (depends on traffic, weather). Despite the 19"" wheels and summer perf. tires the ride is firm without being jarring (test before buying).

I spend about 2 hours of my day commuting and the Audi A4 Quattro 2.0 with the Premium Plus package fits what I need. It has fun and comfort. I'm a big tech geek and the A4 meets my needs. My favorite feature has to be the MMI. I had this car for almost 3 months and it has been excellent ever since except for a few strange rattle noises coming from the doors. It's a big head turner... so be prepared. I have had people in the freeway cruise up to me on the next lane, just so they can turn their head to view the led lights.

5/30/2009,Bomchickawaawaa,"My car choices when searching came down to the BMW 335 sedan, Lexus GS 350, and the Audi A4. I decided to purchase the A4 based on the features and price. The A4 has the quattro AWD, fold down rear seats, 14 speaker Bang and Olufsen system, bluetooth and navigation. I felt that the exterior styling and the better interior features of the A4 outweighed the engine performance of the 335i. The Lexus rear bumper styling just didn't grow on me. So far after driving the car for the first 1000 miles I am so happy about my decision. The A4 is fast off the line and pulling on the freeway in sports mode, the handling is great with the quattro, and it's very eye catching with the LED driving lights.","Bluetooth works great with integration with your contacts.

I chose the Prem Plus Sport Pkg with 18s and 6spd Manual! Audi has completely raised the bar with this one. The sport pkg takes the handling threshold into triple digits with ease. Plus I've been getting 31.3 MPG cruising between 72- 80mph hwy which is unheard of. I had a 2007 Infiniti G35x and never got north of 19MPG.

For our next car purchase safety and engineering were at the top of the requirements list. After a 2002 A6, 2002 TT Roadster, and 2007 A4, we took possession of a 2009 A4 2.0T Quattro with Premier Plus option package. The improvements in the 2009 A4 are impressive and reflect Audi's continued excellence in engineering. This model, with it's increased length and width, adjustments to the engine mounts to reduce the vibration in the 2.0 four cylinder engine, and the tweaks to the acceleration off the line make us feel like we're back in our A6.

When it was up I got an 09 stick premium plus model with sport package and nav, and the car is amazing. The sport suspension really gives the car that sporty feel and the summer tires make the car hug the road and handle amazing. This car also has more low end torque which works really well when getting onto highways. The 2006 model was more sporty, but with the sport package it makes this car a great mix of sport and luxury.","Engine, the day time running LEDs turn heads, love the Ipod integration, but if you get nav it deletes the car's SD card slot, Sport seats, ride, MMI is more user friendly this time around."

Those the car achieves these easily. Living with the car for a while, I would love to give it back. The primary drawback of the vehicle is the very rough ride over 50 MPH. The vehicle seems to transmit every nuance of the road surface into the cabin, the seats, and the floor. The suspension is just far, far too firm. Riding on rougher roads is continuously distracting, with tiny road imperfections intruding into an otherwise palatial experience. I urge anyone considering this vehicle to do an extended test drive.

5/3/2009,Mikey,"If you're the type of driver that wants to look forward to getting in your car, this Audi fits the bill. Our A4 does not have the sport package so the steering and suspension is not as stiff responsive as let's say an S- line Audi, but the ride is a smooth as can be (which my wife prefers). This car is a real standout in the rain, extremely stable which I attribute to the Quattro. Haven't driven it in the snow yet, but I imagine it will perform well. The seats are comfortable and the steering wheel feels great on your hands. Plenty of trunk space. The bluetooth telephone is seamless, hop in the car and the car takes the call. iPod attachment works great as well. Daytime running lights.","Stylish car. Comfortable seating.

I must say that it's such a joy to drive this car everyday that the commute to and from work seems almost tolerable. It feels sporty even without the sports package. Even though the sports package moves it further up the performance ladder, the ride is a little too jarring for the road I drive on. An added bonus on this car is fuel frugality. I am already averaging 25.5 MPG over 1,300 miles (1/5 city and 4/5 highway driving). ","Interior and exterior design, LED daylight running light, lane change assist, keyless entry and start/stop"

However, I cannot be happier. After owning it a few weeks, it has exceeded my high expectations. It is truly an incredible vehicle, with the perfect combination of all the options I was looking for. After initially considering the base (premium) model with the add-ons I wanted, I ultimately opted for the prestige model with all the toys. The icing on the cake is that I paid thousands less than a comparably equipped BMW with better mileage.

This was simply the best bang for the buck. I went with the Premium package with AWD. You don't need anything more than that. I read many reviews by other readers and I agree with the positive vibe on this newly improved model.",The car is well balanced with AWD and the 2.0 engine gives great performance with very good gas mileage. The interior feels like a jet cockpit. The increased vehicle size was a great idea that was much needed.
4/28/2009,Just J,"I wanted a German sedan and test drove the big three. Hands down I was the most impressed with the Audi A4. I went with the 2.0T because it has more torque than the V6! Very responsive and I am getting over 30 MPG on the highway! The MMI interface was better than the other two systems. Hunted down a 2.0T in Black with a Prestige package. I wanted the 18"" rims and the Bang & Olufsen Stereo. The Audi's interior looks rich while the others' look cheaper. The rear seat room is much better in the Audi.",The Bang and Olufsen stereo is by far the best car stereo I have ever heard. The sound reproduction is awesome. Having the iPod interface as well as an SD card slot means all my music comes with me. The front end styling is unique and aggressive. The Smart key technology is cool.
4/28/2009,Derek,"This is my first Audi purchase after many years of Volkswagen ownership and so far I am loving every mile of it. I chose the Premium Plus and 18"" Sport packages. The seats are very comfortable and all controls are easy to use although I find using the MMI creates an extra step to do just about anything except adjust the radio volume. As typical for a German automobile, everything is placed logically. The steering wheel is weighted nicely but the paddles on the back of wheel are too small to make good use of them. I placed my order 10/08 and would have preferred a M/T but the timing just wouldn't work for me to wait that long. Other than that I can't really complain.","LED lights, 18"" wheels, seats, hands- free bluetooth phone, dash layout, steering wheel, overall shape of the car. "

I liked it so much I wanted to see what else Audi had that was just a little bit larger, more comfortable yet just as much fun to drive. The A4 Avant Sport was it. Options I got: Premium Plus, Sport, Navigation, Rear Side Airbags. This car is unbelievable. The BMW 325xi wagon cost $8k more for the same equipment but had a cheaper interior and didn't drive as well. The Infiniti EX had sub-par interior quality although it drove great. However, I'm not going to apologize to my back seat passengers as they trip getting out of the car (small back seat and door opening if I'm buying a $44k car and I would have to do that with the EX).","Interior quality and ergonomics is the best - hands down. Exterior is subtle yet sporty. The MMI is very intuitive. Sport seats are awesome. The car drives great and is very responsive.

Didn't need AWD as we have a SUV at home, so I got the FWD with Sport package in Premium Plus trim. Car drives beautifully, hugs the road esp on turns, sounds great, and the LEDs turn heads for sure.

Put this thing in S mode and drive down a windy road. The car grips the road, and it's substantially different than in D, it's not some gimmick. ","Acceleration, handling, braking. "
1/6/2009,Bobby and Beth Ann,"Being stationed in Europe, I have had the privilege to drive on the infamous Autobahn. I truly believe that Audi is the best German automobile. I have owned three, TT, A6 and now the new A4, all quattros. This new generation Audi is over the top. I bought this car for my wife as an anniversary present. We took a trip together and this car feels, looks, smells, sounds and handles just like a German automobile should. The B & O sound system is the best sound system I have ever heard. Our car comes fully equipped with the exception for navigation and suspension control. The days of notoriety of owning a MB or BMW are over. I always thought they were overrated. ",The sound system is incredible. Daytime running lights. Interior and the layout of the instrument cluster. All safety features that make this car safe. Keyless entry. The looks we get when we are in it.
1/5/2009,Stefan,"I just bought the '09 A4 Avant with Prestige package, Navigation, 19"" Sports package and Drive Select. After about 1200 miles I must say that this is by far the best and most fun car I ever owned. The technology is cutting edge, the interior is on par with any recent Porsche (and much better than its direct competitors) and the performance is much better than the previous generation A4. The new A4 has dethroned the BMW as the true ultimate driving machine. As a previous A4 owner, I am pleased that Audi addressed all design flaws from the B7 models. It now boosts stronger hinges on arm rests, cup holders closer to the center of gravity etc","LED (turns a lot of heads), side assist system, quality feel of interior"
12/31/2008,EmmasDaddy,"After drooling over it since it came out I finally picked up the 2.0 Turbo with the Premium Plus package in brilliant red with tan interior. This car is awesome! The turbo has excellent giddy-up, and the extra foot lbs. of Torque give this car plenty of pop of the line and set it apart from any other seday in its class. The Audi MMI can be challenging at 1st, but once you get the hang of it is very easy to use. I love the ipod integration (a must for me) and the bluetooth phone feature that downloads your phone book. The new body style provides plenty of room in the back for my 3 year old daughter. I had an MDX, and I now love to drive again! ps. The LED's are poppin'! ","Ipod interface, bluetooth phone, LED's, MMI, Quattro AWD."
12/22/2008,Justin,"This is a fantastic vehicle! I test drove numerous vehicles before purchasing the Audi A4 including the Lexus IS250, BMW 328xi, Mercedes-Benz C300 4MATIC, and the Acura TL. The A4 was the best vehicle hands down. The handling of this vehicle on wet and dry roads is excellent. I feel like I'm riding on rails even in the snow. The interior is beautiful and made with high quality materials. Every button and every dial feels great to the touch. The back seat has enough room for even your biggest family members. The trunk is enormous for a 4-door sedan. This vehicle is extremely quick for a 4-cylinder turbo. The back-up camera is unlike any other you've ever seen! LED lights turn heads! ","The Bang & Olufsen sound system is the best sound system I've ever heard in a vehicle! Bluetooth, Navigation, Back- up camera, LED daytime running lights, 18"" wheels and ipod integration are also very cool."
12/18/2008,jfinsure,"My 550i lease just expired and I wanted to downsize the car but not the features. The A4 2.0 with Prestige seemed like just the answer. I have never heard a better car stereo than the B&O system that comes with the Prestige package. The daytime LED's are very cool and this design really hit the target! I was also used to keyless go so this option is now a must have for me. Finally, the side alert is a great feature and my mirrors tell me if someone is in my blind spot with a flashing light. Except for power I actually like this car a lot more than my 550i.","Gas mileage, B&O stereo, Works seamlessly with my iphone, side alert, mmi, daytime led's, back up camera."
11/28/2008,Bob409,The new Audi A4 is perhaps the best of what Audi has produced. The German definition of engineering continues to be distinct with safety first and foremost. This car is fun to drive and I expect Audi to improve on its interior functionality in the next few years. For us larger drivers a better designed front seat would be appreciated. No doubt the quattro all wheel drive system ranks at the top in winter weather. If you are comparing models this is one you have to try.,Handling and quattro all wheel drive system.
11/27/2008,Carson,"I love to drive this car. It's the Prestige with nav and drive select. The handling is unbelievable, combined with a truly solid ride and plenty of power. I was concerned at first whether the car would have sufficient power for my lead foot, but it certainly does, especially in sport mode. You just need to punch it -- with a turbo, one needs to use more pedal than with a non-turbo 6 cyl. The gadgets are wonderful: Nav, bluetooth, Sirius radio, backup parking beeper and camera. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is fabulous, worth the extra. I took the car on a 3000 mile trip. One barely notices getting to high speed, very solid, esp. with dynamic mode. Radar detector needed!","Drive Select-distinct softening in comfort mode, nice for town. Dynamic really tightens up the handling. Sweet on Mulholland Drive with all the other yahoos in their BMW's and Porsches. Sirius-24 hour Grateful Dead and Chill channels. Parking sensor and camera--handy running lights-wife digs em! "
11/25/2008,Frank,"This is an update from my previous review. We got some snow here and I was able to test Quattro system much more than on wet pavement. I confirm that without ASR, handling is exceeding my expectation! I feared that the electronic would limit my fun, but I'm very pleased by the latitude granted by my A4. And with ASR, I know my wife will not be in trouble when driving in the snow. Also, I got my Ipod cable and can confirm that Ipod integration is flawless. I use playlist and store over 350 CDs on my Ipod. Can navigate with ease and of course, sound quality it excellent. The only one thing that disappointed me a bit is the non SDHC support for SD cards which limits capacity to 2GB","Quattro, B&O, fun to drive"
11/24/2008,Dave,"I purchased the A4 with the Prestige package, awesome car. Handles great and has much better performance than previous A4s. The only complaint, automatic transmission seems to shift too early in the lower gears and sometimes feels like it can't make up its mind between 1st and 2nd gear.",Everyone knows you're coming with the LED lights! Bang & Olefsen sound system is superb.
11/18/2008,tom,"Purchased my first Audi vehicle two weeks ago and found a terrific car. I have owned Porsches, Mercedes, VW Passat, VW GTI and all that German design and tecnogolgy finally led me to this beautifully appointed sport sedan. Great looking exterior plus a finely finished interior. Everything about the driver's cockpit is wonderfully situated, easy to reach knobs and dials. Beautifully lit at night. Bang & Olufsen stereo blows all other audio systems away. A great option included in the prestige package along with keyless entry, push button start, stop. Side assist, rear alert. Automatic rain sensor and headlights. I picked the color meteor gray which kinda looks either dark blue or black ","Neat LED daytime running lights, B&O stereo. Overall styling and great gas mileage with 2.0 turbo"
11/15/2008,CAroaddriver,"Bought the A4 2.0T Quattro with the premium plus package. Great exterior styling, good interior, good fit/finish, almost great handling. This car is quicker and better handing than the '99 A6 3.2 I sold. The low-end torque makes it responsive in commute driving, loads of fun in the hills. Getting an honest 30+ mpg on the highway. The trunk is roomy, and the split fold-down rear seat ads versatility some of the other sports sedans lack. The LED daytime running lights turn heads.","Engine performance and exterior styling are great. The Bluetooth cell phone link is a good feature, and the Infotainment system is easy to operate."
11/6/2008,Firecracker,"I got the premium plus package with navigation. I've had the car for a few weeks and absolutely love it! The symphony style LED headlights are my favorite, everyone notices them. The 2.0T engine has plenty of power, I wouldn't want the 3.2L. Audi has done it again!","LED headlights, navigation, new sportier exterior styling"
10/29/2008,snagitseven,"Mine, ordered in May, was in the very first shipment. Compared to my twin turbo 2001 A6, it's a only a bit smaller in the rear seat but very close in the front with more headroom and a larger trunk. While a bit slower of the line to 30, it is faster to 60 than my old twin turbo A6 and definitely a better handler. Have 3000 miles already and just got back from a 1500 mile trip. Very comfortable despite a somewhat stiffer seat than the A6. Overall, very pleased.","Handling, braking, MMI and the incredible B&O audio system. Looks great. The daytime friving LEDs are a really nice touch - gets lots of looks. Love the smoothness and sound of the 3.2 V6 and willing to trade a few mpg."
10/20/2008,Melissa,"I have the premium plus pkg with nav. This is the best car I've ever had. Easy to drive and so much fun. Handles turns extremely well at fast speeds. The gas mileage is pretty good, getting 22ish city. I love the ""smiling"" lights and how they look during the day and at night. I've never felt so safe and comfortable in a car.",The navigation/back up camera and overall design of the car.
10/20/2008,MrJimmy,"Great car for the money. Just bought this car for my wife, looked at BMW X6 - seats only 4? 3 series SUV I wasn't impressed with, I drive a 335i and we needed a winter car. Front end, very aggressive styling and they did a better job with the back end too. Enough for 5 people, dogs and luggage.","LED lights under headlights, very nice styling."
10/19/2008,PyroFire3546,"I bought the A4 Premium Plus about 2 weeks ago, and all I have to say is that it is absolutely amazing. I had looked at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus, and this car defiintely blows them all away. End of story. The handling could not get any better; it is even better than the 2008 Audi A4. The steering is very precise and adapts to how fast or slow you are going. The ride is quiet and smooth, making it a very comfortable car. I could see myself sticking with Audis in the future. Even though the price can be high for some buyers, all I have to say is take a test drive and you will see that you get what you pay for. The car is amazing. I would not change a thing.","Backup camera/sensors, MMI, Nav, bluetooth, steering, iPod interface"
10/15/2008,SmokEater,"I purchased my 2009 A4 Quattro with Premium Plus less then one month ago and I simply can't stop driving this vehicle. It's fun to drive. Turns heads (Daytime Running lights). Simply looks great! Awesome build quality. That is just the start of the reason I love this vehicle. As usual the folks from Audi have done an outstanding job of designing and building this vehicle. The tolerances are very tight, the materials are high quality, and overall design theme is stunning. I've never really been excited about a vehicle until this car!","The Audi Music Interface works great, the Ipod integration is fantastic as is the bluetooth connectivity for cell phones. I love how my contacts are downloaded right into the vehicle so I can easily dial without ever lifting my hands from the wheel. My favorite feature? All of it!"
10/13/2008,selectfpr,"I have owned various BMW's & Audi's over the past 15 years, and this seems to be one of my favorites. I just ended an X3 lease and was considering the 328xi wagon or the A4 Avant. To my surprise, I chose the Avant with the Premium Plus Package, because they really made a lot of advancements since my 2004 Audi. Until BMW redesigns the 328, the Audi 2.0 I think is a much better car. It handles great, it's feels much quicker than the 328, and the interior and exterior design (at least on the Avant) is a real winner. So far, I think it's a no brainer.","The MMI is very cool. The 2.0 is much better than I thought it would be. Handling is very crisp. I can really throw it through turns. Seats are very comfortable. Seems to get pretty good gas mileage. Finally, being a wagon, there's lots of cargo space. Why would anybody choose an SUV"
10/10/2008,Ammo,"I picked it up 2 weeks ago in Aruba Blue. Love the car and the color. I test drove several cars before decided on A4. You can't compare beautiful interior & exterior designing with any other car in its class. When turbo kicks in you feel you are drving on the race track not on a highway. Love the MMI, bluetooth and iPod features. I love it.","Great pick up, awesome interior, great sound system & MMI."
10/2/2008,David,"Had this car for three weeks and I have nothing but good things too say about it. Stylish exterior with just as beautiful interior. Acceleration and power feel much better than when I tested the 2009 TSX which is also a four-banger but not quite as responsive as the other competitors that have a V6. Safety is pretty much on par with everyone else as well but Quattro is a big plus since that's the only real fulltime AWD in its class. I like that automatic not only has a manual shift mode, but also a sport autoshift that lets the car stay in lower gears longer for more power. All in all a real eye-catcher inside and out that gets decent MPG for an AWD and has just enough zip to have fun.","All new styling and increased HP, torque, MPG, and room than the old model. Trunk also big enough to fit my golf clubs and much much more."
9/29/2008,Mobilehavoc,"I've had the car for 3 weeks and 600 miles of driving so far. I got the Premium Plus trim with Navigation and I'm really loving the car. It has the exterior looks, interior styling/finish and performance that make it the true triple-threat. For a V4 turbo, it delivers a consistent torque through the RPM range making it a pure joy to drive coupled with the excellent all- time quattro AWD. The interior is Audi at it's best with an excellent MMI system - for all intents and purposes is the same interior of the more expensive A6/Q7 models. Everything is designed to make the driver's job as effortless and enjoyable as possible and I have no regrets whatsoever in purchasing this car. Recommended","Performance of 2.0T engine is excellent while still giving great gas mileage. Interior styling, finish and technology is same as more expensive A6/Q7 model. The LED DRLs are unique and attention grabbing, add personal flair to the car. Rain sensing wipers/auto headlights make effortless driving"
9/28/2008,John,"Just purchased the new A4- significant improvements over previous generation. Tested Mercedes C class, BMW 3 series, Infinti G35, Lexus IS before deciding on Audi. Vehicle has premium pckg, Technology pckg, B&O stereo system. All options worth the extra cost- stereo is wonderful, MMI much easier and intuitive than BMW, steering is very crisp, engine is very good, transmission very smooth, shifting in manual mode is great! As expected, interior is best in class and extra length to car has resulted in much better back seat space than previous versions- tall people will still find back a bit cramped though. Save money + stay with base engine- turbo is great!","Engine, transmission, steering, brakes are all great. Stereo is awesome- car looks great (white/black) and new headlights work and look great! Seats are comfortable as well"
9/27/2008,golfgal,"I had been researching the '09 A4 since March 08 - I ordered it in July and picked it up 2 weeks ago. The car is everything I'd hoped for. It is beautifully redesigned with a sportier & elegant lines. The headlights are making heads turn on the road!! The trunk is spacious; interior is luxurious and roomy. I debated on waiting for the 6-speed manual, but decided to go with the 6-speed tiptronic. The response is quick with a very smooth shifting; excellent acceleration. I have the premium plus package with navigation/back up camera option. There are abundant features included in the premium plus package; I also added the navigation package which included the MMI.","MMI: I love the interface which controls the bluetooth, iPod (Audi Music Interface), navigation and audio selections. Best part is I don't even have to take my phone out of my bag. It picks up the contacts in my Blackberry so I can dial right from the MMI!"
9/24/2008,scott,"I wish this car had better MPG. That's my only complaint so far. It's competitive with others, but I'm finding closer to 26/27 on the highway versus 30/31 as dealerships tend to suggest you'll get, rather than the numbers listed on the window. Then again, who trusts car dealerships. I find the front seat very very comfortable and since I do a lot of highway driving, this is a big plus.",
9/24/2008,Frank,"Of course my car is new and I'm so happy and exited about my choice; but I did test all AWD cars in that segment, then chose A4 for the style, size (bmw too small), quality of the interior, ultimate sound system. Handling, fun to drive is great! Performance is more than enough for me, but lack brute force of G35x or BMW335xi. This is the only item for which the A4 is not getting perfect score across the board. B&O sound system is a marvel! Way superior than previous Bose option. And with the SD card support, I even don't need to use CD (6 disk changer, MP3 support). It comes with ipod integration, I'm expecting the ipod cable delivery soon and will provide feedback on it. ","Fuel economy for a 6cyl, it's great! Handling in corners. Sound system."
9/22/2008,Andreas,"The new A4 is an all around excellent auto. It surpasses all others in its class and then some. Wheelbase is similar to the MBenz E-class. Style is literally a jaw dropper. Acceleration 0-60 is better than my 225hp TT which was 6.3 sec. Im guessing the A4 3.2 quattro is similar to the A5 3.2 rating of 5.8sec 0-60, not the 6.3 posted on the Audi website. The exhaust sound is deep and throaty. Braking is quick with minimal nose dive. The best feature is the steering feel. It's very light and nimble. Interior and exterior finish quality is top notch. I test drove this car at Infineon raceway a few months ago and couldn't wait for its arrival. A well equipped A4 3.2 quattro for $40k, what a deal!",The A4 3.2 quattro is fully loaded and well worth the extra $4k. Seats are heated and/or cooled. The LED daytime driving lights are a big attention grabber. The best feature is the steering response.
